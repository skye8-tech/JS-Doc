        <p>
        <h2> Introduction:</h2>
        JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language used for creating interactive and dynamic web
        applications. It
        is a versatile and flexible language that is supported by all modern web browsers. JavaScript allows developers
        to
        create dynamic and responsive user interfaces and add interactivity to web pages. It is also used for
        server-side
        programming with Node.js.

        <h2>Where to:</h2>
        JavaScript code can be added to HTML pages using script tags, which allows you to write JavaScript code directly
        in the
        HTML document. Alternatively, you can create a separate JavaScript file with the .js extension and include it in
        your
        HTML document. JavaScript can also be used for server-side programming with Node.js, which allows you to write
        JavaScript code that runs on the server.

        <h2>Output:</h2>
        The output of JavaScript code can be displayed on the browser's console or as part of an HTML page. You can use
        the
        <code>console.log()</code> method to display output on the console or use the <code>document.write()</code>
        method to display
        output on an HTML
        page.

        Here is an example of displaying output on the console using <code>console.log():</code>

        <pre>
              <code>
    let message = 'Hello, world!';
    console.log(message); // Output: Hello, world!
              </code>
            </pre>


        Here is an example of displaying output on an HTML page using <code>document.write()</code>:

        <pre>
              <code>
    let message = 'Hello, world!';
    document.write(message);
              </code>
            </pre>

        <h2>Statements:</h2>
        JavaScript code consists of statements, which are instructions that the computer executes. JavaScript statements
        can be
        grouped together into blocks using curly braces. Statements are terminated with a semicolon (;) by convention,
        although
        it is not required in all cases.

        Here is an example of using a statement in JavaScript:

        <pre>
              <code>
    let x = 5;
    if (x < 10) { console.log('x is less than 10'); }   
              </code>
            </pre>
        <h2>Syntax: </h2>
        JavaScript syntax is similar to other programming
        languages, with variables, functions, loops, and conditional statements. JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses
        keywords such as let, const, function, if, else, while, for, and switch. Here is an example of using syntax in
        JavaScript:
        <pre>
                <code> 
    function greet(name) { 
      console.log('Hello, ' + name + ' !'); 
    } greet('John'); 
    // Output: Hello, John!
                </code>
              </pre>
        In conclusion, JavaScript is a versatile and powerful language used for creating interactive and dynamic web
        applications. By understanding the basic syntax and structure of JavaScript, developers can create responsive
        and
        engaging user interfaces and build complex applications with ease.

        <h1 id="variable">Variables</h1>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a popular programming language that is widely used for creating dynamic and interactive web
          pages. As a
          language, JavaScript is known for its flexibility and ease of use, making it a popular choice among
          developers. In this
          article, we will explore some of the key features of JavaScript, including comments, variables, let, const,
          var,
          operations, arithmetic, assignment, and data types, with coding examples for each.

        <h2> Comments </h2>
        Comments are used in JavaScript to add explanatory text to your code. They are not executed by the browser, but
        are
        instead used by developers to explain what the code does. There are two types of comments in JavaScript:
        single-line
        comments and multi-line comments.

        Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//). For example:

        <pre>
    <code>
  // This is a single-line comment
    </code>
  </pre>

        Multi-line comments are enclosed in /* and */. For example:

        <pre>
    <code>
    /* This is a
    multi-line
    comment */
    </code>
  </pre>

        <h2>Variables </h2>

        Variables are used to store data in a program. In JavaScript, variables can be declared using three keywords:
        let,
        const, and var.

        The let keyword is used to declare variables that can be reassigned later. For example:

        <pre>
    <code>
  let x = 5;
  x = 6;
    </code>
  </pre>

        The const keyword is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned. For example:

        <pre>
    <code>
    const y = 10;
    </code>
  </pre>

        The var keyword is the older way of declaring variables in JavaScript, but it is still commonly used. Variables
        declared
        with var have a function scope, while variables declared with let and const have block scope. For example:

        <pre>
    <code>
  var z = 15;
  function myFunction() {
    var z = 20;
    console.log(z); // Output: 20
  }
  console.log(z); // Output: 15
    </code>
  </pre>

        <h2>Operations</h2>

        In JavaScript, there are several types of operations that can be performed on data. These include arithmetic
        operations,
        assignment operations, comparison operations, and logical operations.

        Arithmetic Operations

        Arithmetic operations are used to perform calculations on data. JavaScript supports several arithmetic
        operators,
        including + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), and % (modulo). For example:

        <pre>
    <code>
  let a = 5;
  let b = 10;
  let c = a + b;
  console.log(c); // Output: 15
    </code>
  </pre>

        <h2>Assignment </h2>

        Assignment operations are used to assign values to variables. In JavaScript, the = operator is used for
        assignment. For
        example:

        <pre>
    <code>
  let x = 5;
  x = 10;
  console.log(x); // Output: 10
    </code>
  </pre>

        <h2>Comparison </h2>

        Comparison operations are used to compare two values and return a Boolean value. JavaScript supports several
        comparison
        operators, including == (equal to), != (not equal to), > (greater than), < (less than),>= (greater than or equal
          to),
          and <= (less than or equal to). For example: <pre>
            <code>
  let a=5; let b=10; 
  console.log(a> b); // Output: false
  console.log(a == b); // Output: false
  console.log(a < b); // Output: true 
    </code>
            </pre>

            <h2>Logical Operations </h2>

            Logical operations are used to combine multiple Boolean values and return a single Boolean value. JavaScript
            supports
            several logical operators, including && (and), || (or), and ! (not). For example:
            <pre>
    <code>
  let a=5; let b=10; 
  console.log(a> 0 && b < 20); // Output: true 
  console.log(a < 0 || b < 20); // Output: true 
  console.log(!(a> b)); // Output: true
    </code>
  </pre>

            <h2>Data Types </h2>

            JavaScript supports several
            </p>
            <h1 id="data-types">Data Tyoes</h1>
            <p>
              Data types in JavaScript are an important aspect of the language. They define the different types of
              values that can be
              stored in variables and manipulated in code. In this article, we will explore the different data types in
              JavaScript and
              provide coding examples for each.

              Primitive Data Types

              Primitive data types are the most basic types of data in JavaScript. They are immutable, meaning that
              their values
              cannot be changed once they are created. There are six primitive data types in JavaScript: `undefined`,
              `null`,
              `boolean`, `number`, `string`, and `symbol`.

              1. `undefined`: The `undefined` data type represents a value that has not been assigned yet. Here is an
              example:

            <pre>
    <code>
  let x;
  console.log(x); // Output: undefined
      </code>
  </pre>

            2. `null`: The `null` data type represents a value that is intentionally empty. Here is an example:

            <pre>
    <code>
  let y = null;
  console.log(y); // Output: null
    </code>
  </pre>

            3. `boolean`: The `boolean` data type represents a logical value that can be either `true` or `false`. Here
            is an
            example:

            <pre>
    <code>
  let isStudent = true;
  console.log(isStudent); // Output: true
      </code>
  </pre>

            4. `number`: The `number` data type represents a numeric value. Here is an example:

            <pre>
    <code>
  let age = 25;
  console.log(age); // Output: 25
      </code>
  </pre>

            5. `string`: The `string` data type represents a sequence of characters. Here is an example:

            <pre>
    <code>
  let name = "John";
  console.log(name); // Output: John
      </code>
  </pre>

            6. `symbol`: The `symbol` data type represents a unique identifier. Here is an example:

            <pre>
    <code>
  let id = Symbol("123");
  console.log(id); // Output: Symbol(123)
      </code>
  </pre>

            Object Data Type

            The `object` data type is a complex data type that can store collections of data in the form of key-value
            pairs. Objects
            are mutable, meaning that their values can be changed after they are created. Here is an example:

            <pre>
    <code>
  let person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 25,
  isStudent: true
  };
  console.log(person); // Output: { name: "John", age: 25, isStudent: true }
      </code>
  </pre>

            Arrays Data Type

            The `array` data type is a special type of object that can store a collection of data. Arrays are mutable,
            meaning that
            their values can be changed after they are created. Here is an example:

            <pre>
    <code>
  let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
  console.log(fruits); // Output: ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
      </code>
  </pre>

            Type Conversions

            JavaScript allows for type conversions between different data types. This can be done implicitly or
            explicitly.

            Implicit Conversion:

            <pre>
    <code>
  let num = 10;
  let str = "5";
  let result = num + str;
  console.log(result); // Output: 105 (the string "5" is implicitly converted to a number)
      </code>
  </pre>

            Explicit Conversion:

            <pre>
    <code>
  let str = "5";
  let num = Number(str);
  console.log(num); // Output: 5 (the string "5" is explicitly converted to a number using the Number() function)
      </code>
  </pre>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>

            Data types in JavaScript are essential for manipulating and working with values in code. Understanding the
            different
            data types and how they can be used is crucial for writing effective JavaScript programs. By utilizing the
            various data
            types and type conversions in JavaScript, developers can create powerful and flexible applications.

            <h1 id="function">Functions</h1>
            <p>
              Functions in JavaScript are a powerful feature that allows developers to write reusable blocks of code.
              They are a key
              part of the language and are used extensively in many JavaScript applications. In this article, we will
              explore what
              functions are, how they work, and provide coding examples for each.

              What are Functions?

              A function in JavaScript is a set of instructions that can be called and executed at any point in the
              program. Functions
              are used to encapsulate a block of code and can be reused in different parts of the program.

              Functions can take in arguments, perform operations, and return a value. Arguments are values passed into
              the function
              when it is called, and the returned value is the result of the function's execution.

              Creating a Function

              A function can be created in JavaScript using the `function` keyword, followed by the name of the function
              and a set of
              parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we can list the parameters that the function will take.

              Here is an example of a simple function that takes in two arguments and returns their sum:

            <pre>
    <code>
  function addNumbers(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
  }
    </code>
  </pre>

            In this function, `num1` and `num2` are the parameters, and `return num1 + num2` is the operation that is
            performed on
            the parameters. The `return` keyword indicates what value the function will return when it is called.

            Calling a Function

            Once a function is defined, it can be called at any point in the program by using the function name followed
            by a set of
            parentheses. When a function is called, any arguments that are passed in are used as the values for the
            function's
            parameters.

            Here is an example of how to call the `addNumbers` function that we defined earlier:

            <pre>
    <code>
  let sum = addNumbers(3, 4);
  console.log(sum); // Output: 7
    </code>
  </pre>

            In this example, we are calling the `addNumbers` function and passing in the arguments `3` and `4`. The
            function returns
            the sum of these two numbers, which is stored in the `sum` variable. The `console.log` statement then
            outputs the value
            of `sum`, which is `7`.

            Function Expressions

            In addition to the `function` keyword, JavaScript also allows for function expressions. A function
            expression is a
            function that is assigned to a variable, and can be called using that variable.

            Here is an example of a function expression that does the same thing as our `addNumbers` function:

            <pre>
    <code>
  let add = function(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
  };
    </code>
  </pre>

            In this example, the `add` variable is assigned a function that takes in two parameters and returns their
            sum. This
            function can then be called by using the `add` variable, like this:

            <pre>
    <code>
  let sum = add(3, 4);
  console.log(sum); // Output: 7
    </code>
  </pre>

            Arrow Functions

            Arrow functions are a newer way of defining functions in JavaScript, introduced in ECMAScript 6. They are a
            more concise
            way of writing functions, and are often used in modern JavaScript code.

            Here is an example of an arrow function that does the same thing as our `addNumbers` function:

            <pre>
    <code>
  let add = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;
    </code>
  </pre>

            In this example, the `add` variable is assigned an arrow function that takes in two parameters and returns
            their sum.
            This function can then be called by using the `add` variable, like this:

            <pre>
    <code>
  let sum = add(3, 4);
  console.log(sum); // Output: 7
    </code>
  </pre>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>

            Functions in JavaScript are a powerful feature that allow developers to write reusable blocks of code. They
            can take in
